 RISC-V-MYTH-WORKSHOP

DAY 1:
Writing a C CODE for the sum of n integers and compling it and seeing it in assembly language for the RISC V.

We performed the same for signed and unsigned integers.

DAY 2:

We wrote a program in assembly language and complied it using the RISC V architecture and ran it. Further, We converted it HEX code and used it to process trhought the PICORV 32 core.

DAY 3:

We were trained on transcation level verilog and asked us to implement different logic gates and build a calculator with validty recall and memory.
